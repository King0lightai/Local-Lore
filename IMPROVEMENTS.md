# Scribber Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to Scribber for better reliability, performance, and user experience in a self-hosted environment.

## Key Improvements

### 1. SQLite Database Backend
- **File**: `scribber/backend/server-improved.js`
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents data corruption from concurrent writes
  - Better performance with indexed queries
  - Atomic transactions for data integrity
  - Automatic backups possible
  - Word count tracking for chapters

### 2. Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- Maximum length limits to prevent issues
- Required field validation
- Protects against accidental data corruption

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Loading states for better UX
- Graceful error recovery
- No more silent failures

### 4. Export Functionality
- Export entire novels as JSON
- Preserves all story elements
- Easy backup solution
- Format suitable for import later

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Prepared SQL statements for speed
- Efficient database indexes
- Batch operations in transactions
- Debounced auto-save
- No more page reloads

### 6. Better User Experience
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Loading spinners during operations
- Save status indicators
- Manual save button
- Word count display
- Export button in UI

## Migration Guide

### From JSON to SQLite

1. **Backup your data** (the JSON files in `scribber/backend/data/`)

2. **Run the migration**:
   ```
   migrate-to-sqlite.bat
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```
   cd scribber\backend
   npm install better-sqlite3
   node migrate-to-sqlite.js
   ```

3. **Start the new backend**:
   ```
   start-backend-sqlite.bat
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```
   cd scribber\backend
   npm run start:sqlite
   ```

4. **Verify your data** - Open the app and check that all novels, chapters, and story elements migrated correctly

5. **Archive JSON files** (optional) - Once verified, you can move the old JSON files to a backup folder

## New Features

### Word Count
- Automatic word counting for all chapters
- Displayed in the editor header
- Stored in database for tracking

### Export
- Click the download icon next to the novel title
- Exports complete novel data as JSON
- Includes all chapters and story elements

### Better Save System
- Auto-save with visual feedback
- Manual save button
- Save status indicators (Saving/Saved/Error)
- Prevents data loss

### Toast Notifications
- Success messages (green)
- Error messages (red)
- Info messages (blue)
- Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicates
- Indexes for performance
- Timestamps for all records

### API Improvements
- Consistent error responses
- Input validation middleware
- Transaction support
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Frontend Enhancements
- React hooks for state management
- Proper error boundaries
- Loading states
- Optimistic UI updates

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Issues
- Check console for specific error messages
- Ensure JSON files are valid
- Verify write permissions in data directory

### Performance Issues
- Database is automatically indexed
- Old JSON files can be archived
- Check browser console for errors

### Data Integrity
- SQLite ensures ACID compliance
- Transactions prevent partial updates
- Foreign keys maintain relationships

## Future Enhancements
While not implemented in this update, here are potential future improvements:

1. **Auto-backup** - Scheduled backups to cloud or local directory
2. **Import functionality** - Import exported novels
3. **Search** - Full-text search across chapters
4. **Version history** - Track changes over time
5. **Writing statistics** - Daily word counts, streaks, etc.
6. **Themes** - Dark mode and custom themes
7. **Markdown export** - Export chapters as markdown files
8. **Chapter reordering** - Drag and drop chapters

## Support
For issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the backend is running
3. Ensure you're using the SQLite backend
4. Check file permissions on Windows
