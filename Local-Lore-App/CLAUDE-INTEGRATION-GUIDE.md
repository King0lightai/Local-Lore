```
Claude will use `get_story_context` to show all characters, places, events, lore, and items.

```
Claude, please read chapter 2 from novel 1, then help me continue writing it
```
Claude will:
1. Use `get_chapter` to read the current content
2. Use `get_story_context` to understand your world
3. Help you write new content
4. Use `update_chapter` to save changes

Claude will use `add_character` to create a proper character entry.

### **5. Analyze Your Writing**

Claude, based on all the events in my novel so far, help me brainstorm what should happen next
```
